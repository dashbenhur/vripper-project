# VRipper!

This is my spin for a cross-platform gallery ripper for [vipergirls.to](https://vipergirls.to).

## How to build

You need JDK 21 and a recent version of maven 3.6.1+

To build run the following:

    mvn clean install

Build artifact is located under

    vripper-project\vripper-gui\target\vripper-gui-{{version}}.jar

Copy the artifact into any other folder and run:

    java -jar vripper-gui-{{version}}.jar
